# Classroom Collaborative Application Framework

Classroom Collaborative Application Framework facilitates better collaborative
learning in classrooms by connecting groups of students and providing valuable
analytical tools to teachers. The framework combines three powerful features:
a collaborative drawing application for students, and real-time classroom
visualization dashboard for teachers, and recording and playback of student
drawing activity for later analysis.


## For students

Small groups of students can work together on assignments using tablets to draw
on a shared document.


## For teachers

Statistics from the drawing application are collected and organized for the
teacher to provide a visual representation of the progress and level of activity
of each student. Students' drawing activity is recorded and may be played back
later.
